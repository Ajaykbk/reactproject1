api call in js
--------------

AJAX
 -XMLhttp
 -fetch
 -asynch await


 useEffect : An hook used in place of ngOnInit(in angular).

 redirection in react
 --------------------

 react-router-dom
 instaall -- npm i react-router-dom

 import {
     BrowserRouter as router - all routing need components
     ,Routes   - to set paths for each component
     ,Route    - more than one path
      } from 'react-router-dom';

useParams :- hook used to access params from component url

REDUX   (important in react)
-----
coupling : many connection between parent and child component

props drilling : In coupling,if any intermediate component have any errors or 
                 all other childs will not work.This process is called 
                 props drilling.

To avoid props drilling we need to reduce coupling and make all the components independent,
For this React introduced a new technology :- state management technology - REDUX


REDUX process
-------------

-Create a new js file to keep the states,all the components can access the js file

-the components can access the datas from the js file,but they can't update data in js file

   ------------                     ------------------
     reducer    (a)                     
   ------------                          data.js         (b)
                                         
                                         state
                                                                               (b) --> (c) 
                                   -------------------                         (c) --> (d)
                                                                               (d) --> (a)
                                                                               (a) --> (b)
                                          
                                          
                                           
                                          
   -----------------             ------------------
           logic      (d)             component         (c)
     Action                      -------------------
   -----------------  

   Action :- a file where all the logics to update the state

   Dispatch:- method used to dispatch the logic in action file when the component
              need state updation.
   
   Reducer:- update the datas in js file according to the payload response get from
             action file.


  libraries to aply REDUX
  -----------------------

  1.REDUX
  2.REACT-REDUX
  3.REDUX-THUNK

         for installing : npm redux react-redux redux-thunk

createStore() :- method in REDUX used to create store in js file
               - 2 arguments in this method
               - one is reducer , two is a middleware

               here middileware is used to make synchronous redux into asynchronous

applyMiddileware() :- method in REDUX to apply middleware

combineReducers() :- method in REDUX used to combine all the reducers in js file

thunk() :- method in REDUX-THUNK used to create middleware


1.create store
2.apply the store in index.js       
    - Provider :- it is a tag used to pass the store (react-redux)
